# React Exercise
This repo aims to work as a quick exercise to better understand react by creating the beginnings of a tictactoe game.

** IMPORTANT **
The curly braces around the comments are part of the comment, do not include them in your code!

## Getting Started
1. To get started navigate to this website: https://codepen.io/rennemannd/pen/zYOJzNB?editors=0010
2. On this website ignore the html and css tags and only use the JS tab to write your react app.
3. There are three main components to this code and each is missing something. The game class renders a Board component, and the Board component renders Square components.

## Assignment
1. Look for the TODO in the square class and replace the comment with code to set state.value to 'X'
2. Look for the TODO in the Board class and add the missing part to return the div tag of squares.
3. Look for the TODO in the Game class and add the code to render the Board component
